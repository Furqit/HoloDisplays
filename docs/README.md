## Overview

HoloDisplays is a powerful, high-performance Minecraft mod that enables the creation of efficient virtual holograms using packet-based display entities. Unlike traditional hologram plugins that spawn real entities (which can cause server lag), HoloDisplays leverages Minecraft's built-in display entities sent via network packets. This approach minimizes server load while providing flexible, customizable visual effects for text, items, blocks, and entities.

The mod is designed for Fabric Loader on Minecraft versions 1.20.5 to 1.21.x. It integrates seamlessly with mods like Placeholder API for dynamic content and supports advanced text formatting, including gradients and color codes.

## Key Benefits

* **Performance**: No entity spawning means lower TPS impact, even with hundreds of holograms.
* **Flexibility**: Supports animations, conditions, and multiple display types.
* **Ease of Use**: Intuitive GUI for management, plus a comprehensive command system.
* **Developer-Friendly**: Public API for mod integration.

## Features

* **Multiple Display Types**: Text with multi-line support and gradients; items with render types; blocks and entities with scaling and poses.
* **Hologram Management**: Group displays with offsets, configure scale, rotation, view range, and conditions.
* **Animations**: Frame-based text cycling (planned: item/block animations).
* **Integration**: Compatible with Placeholder API for dynamic placeholders.
* **User Interface**: GUI editors for all aspects; command alternatives.
* **API**: Register holograms/displays programmatically.
